📦 Essentials Connect
Essentials Connect is a mobile application that bridges the gap between donors (like restaurants) and receivers (NGOs) through the help of volunteers. It ensures efficient donation management, minimizes food wastage, and helps distribute essentials to those in need. The system allows seamless coordination between different user roles to manage, track, and deliver donations in real-time.
